# Correlation Analysis for Movie Industry Dataset using Python

In this project, I will be working to find correlations between certain variables for the Movie Industry dataset provided in Kaggle. The project contains two parts, cleaning the dataset and using seaborn and matplotlib libraries to find correlations.

All the codes would be provided in 'Correlation Analysis Project.ipynb'.

The dataset can be downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies.
